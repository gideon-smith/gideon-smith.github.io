        All elder gods are weak,
        They can't escape the galaxy nor change it in any meaningful way,
        They can not change the laws of physics,
        They are subject to time like all other beings in existence,
        They canâ€™t change the fate of the universe doomed by the law of entropy, and dark energy,
        All elder  gods are weak.
