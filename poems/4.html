        The stormy winter night is cold:
The cold hard rain falls,
The freezing wave crash on the frozen beach,
The cold wind howls sucking warmth away,
From the deep cold oceans depths the hulking mass of an elder god emerges to go somewhere warmer to live,



The stormy night is warm:
The massive elder god stays warm under its three foot thick pelt,
While in the sky the clouds shield you from the cold ominous expanse of space,
In cabin a wood stove burns comfortingly it warms house With its blaze,
The blanket keeps you warm while the cat purrs lovingly.
