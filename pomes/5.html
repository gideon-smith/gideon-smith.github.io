        The space between galaxies is is empty:
No galaxies in light years,
No stars in miles,
Not a speck of dust as far as the eye can see,
A deep black void everywhere,


The space between galaxies is full: 
Millions of hydrogen atoms everywhere,
A bubbling up madness of quarks and antiquarks,
The small bits of background radiation from the big bang,
The faint bits of light coming from galaxies far away.
